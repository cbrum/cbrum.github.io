  <h1>About me</h1>
<article>
  <p>My name is Cecilia Brum, I’m a UI/UX Designer who lives in Montevideo, Uruguay.</p>

<p>I am veteran in the field,  I have been in it for almost 10 years now,
   and what a decade it’s been!</p>

<p>At first, web designer meant to design User interfaces (UI) for the web,
 and building them with html and css, for developers to work the backend
 and add functionality.</p>

<p>Over time the field has changed quite a bit. Building and designing became more complex in themselves, and through the process part of my colleagues headed for the "building" side, and became what's now called: frontend developers.
I... went in the other direction, which at the begining was focused just on UI.
As time went by, UI became just an aspect of a bigger whole.
Other parts of the puzzle emerged, like usability, interaction and accessibility,
 expanding it all into broader concept:<strong> User Experience (UX)</strong>.</p>

<p>I was there to be part of such changes in the industry and our daily lives.
Since the begning, I’ve learnt a lot about working with with UI, html and css, I’ve even coded for a while.
I got to learn from amazingly talented people from many backgrounds and places, even when being a teacher I learnt a lot from my students. 
In recent years, mobile phones opened a new world of possibility and challenge,  and diving into UX was inevitable for me.</p>

<p>A lot has happened over the last decade, and I’m happy I’m a part of it. 
  I love what I do, I love co-creating experiences, always eager to improve myself and
  curious to know what comes next, in a world that was bearly glimpsed when I first got into it.</p>
